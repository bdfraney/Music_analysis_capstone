# Audio Analysis and Genre Classification
by Blake Franey

---

### Problem Statement:
One of the fundamental problems in audio processing is audio classification.  Extracting useful features from auido data and using those to place audio into classes is essential to a lot of applications - especially genre classification in music.  Using royalty-free music scraped from various websites I will use a neural network, primarily a convolutional neural network, to classify the songs into 6 separate genres: Techno, House, Indie-rock, Garage-rock, Dubstep, and Drum and Bass.
